# 7.0 Templates

The Polls module has four templates, which are available through Admin -> System Module -> Templates -> Polls. They are:

**xoopspoll_index.html**

This template displays the index page for the Polls module (ie. the page displayed from the ‘Polls’ link in the main menu). It provides a list of currently active polls.

**xoopspoll_view.html**

This template displays an expanded view of a poll when a visitor i) clicks on the ‘vote’ button in the Polls block without selecting a choice, or ii) clicks on a poll name in the Poll index page.

**xoopspoll_results.html**

This template controls the layout of the ‘Results’ page where visitors can review the current state of a poll.

**xoopspoll_block_poll.html**

This is the template for the Polls block. It shows an unlimited number of polls / surveys. If you want to customize the appearance of your polls this is the template you need to modify.
