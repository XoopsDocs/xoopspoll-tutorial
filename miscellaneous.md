**Group permissions**

You must give relevant user groups access rights to i\) the Polls module and ii\) the Polls block so that they can vote \(System module -&gt; Groups\). Detailed information on configuring group permissions is available in the Operations Manual if you need it.

**Interpreting poll results**

Be careful how you interpret the feedback you get from polls. Bear in mind that only motivated users will respond â€“ respondents probably do not represent a representative cross-section of your community!
